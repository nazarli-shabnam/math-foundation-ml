        Start with definition of $\mathbb E \xi$,
        $$\mathbb E \xi = \sum_k p(\xi=x_k) x_k,$$
        where k runs over all possible $x_k$ outputs
    - text: |
        Using the classical definition of probability, we may think of $p(\xi = x_k)$ as
        about a fraction of the experiments that yield $x_k$ as the output
    - text: |
        Thus, we can rewrite
        $$\mathbb E \xi = \sum_k p(\xi=x_k) x_k = \sum_k \frac{\#(\xi = x_k)}{N} x_k = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n,$$
        where $\xi_n$ is the $n$-th instance of random value $\xi$ and $n$ runs through all of
        the $N$ experiments

        Consider $\mathbb E (a \xi + b \eta)$ and rewrite as average of many experiments:
    - text: |
        $$\mathbb E (a \xi + b \eta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N a \xi_n + b \eta_n$$
    - text: |
        Rewriting this formula, we will get:
        $$\mathbb E (a \xi + b \eta) = a \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \xi_n + b \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N b \eta_n$$
    - text: |
        But we know that
        $$\mathbb E \xi =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \xi_n$$
        $$\mathbb E \eta =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \eta_n$$
    - text: |
        Thus, we have proved:
        $$\mathbb E (\xi + \eta) = a \mathbb E \xi + b \mathbb E \eta$$
