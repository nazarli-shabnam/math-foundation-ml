        Consider the differential of the product of two functions:
        $$d (f(x) g(x))$$
    - text: |
        Expand the differential of the product of two functions:
        $$d (f(x) g(x)) = f(x) dg(x) + g(x) df(x)$$
    - text: |
        Integrate both sides of the equation:
        $$\int d (f(x) g(x)) = \int f(x) dg(x) + \int g(x) df(x)$$
    - text: |
        Recalling that integration is opposed to differentiation:
        $$\int d(f(x) g(x)) = f(x) g(x) + C$$
    - text: |
        Insert this expression to the left side of the equation:
        $$f(x) g(x) = \int f(x) dg(x) + \int g(x) df(x)$$
    - text: |
        Rearrange the terms to get the integration by parts formula:
        $$\int f(x) dg(x) = f(x) g(x) - \int g(x) df(x)$$
