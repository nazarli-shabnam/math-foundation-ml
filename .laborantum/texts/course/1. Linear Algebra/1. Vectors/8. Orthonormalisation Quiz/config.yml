    - text: Take the first vector $\mathbf x_1$
    - text: |
        Normalise it and add to the new system of vectors 
        $$\mathbf x_1^* = \frac{\mathbf x_1}{|\mathbf x_1|}$$
    - text: |
        Take the next vector $\mathbf x_2$
    - text: |
        Remove from it all colinear components with the vectors that are already
        in the system making the new vector orthogonal to all of them:

        $$\mathbf x_2^* = \mathbf x_2 - \left<\mathbf x_2, \mathbf x_1^*\right> 
        \mathbf x_1^*$$
    - text: |
        Normalise the result:
        $$\mathbf x_2^* = \frac{\mathbf x_2^*}{|\mathbf x_2^*|}$$
    - text: |
        Repeat previous 3 steps for the remaining vectors in the original system
